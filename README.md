Introduction
Problem Statement: Blackjack offers a stochastic environment ideal for testing reinforcement learning due to its diverse rule sets. This project investigates how RL agents generalize across variants with different complexities.
Motivation: Generalization is a key challenge in RL, especially for dynamic or unseen environments. Blackjack variants provide a controlled setting to study this, with real-world relevance in adaptive systems.
Objectives:
Examine learning dynamics of Q-learning, DQN, PPO, and other RL algorithms across Blackjack variants.
Integrate human strategies (e.g., basic strategy, card counting) for comparative analysis.
Assess generalization across multi-deck setups, rule changes, and betting systems.
Create an advanced, portfolio-worthy project for a Master's in AI application.
Background
Blackjack Overview:
Core Rules: Players aim for a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding it. Actions: hit, stand, double down, split.
Variants:
Deck counts: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8.
Dealer behavior: hits or stands on soft 17.
Payouts: 3:2 vs. 6:5 for Blackjack.
Additional rules: side bets, surrender options.
Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:
Q-learning: Tabular, off-policy method for discrete state-action pairs.
Deep Q-learning (DQN): Neural network approximation for large state spaces.
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): Policy gradient method with clipped objectives for stability.
Other Algorithms: SARSA, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Actor-Critic methods.
Human Strategies:
Basic Strategy: Rule-based decisions based on player hand and dealer upcard.
Card Counting: Techniques like Hi-Lo to track deck composition.
Betting Systems: Strategies like Martingale or Paroli for wager adjustments.
Methodology
Environment Setup
Blackjack Simulation:
Use OpenAI Gym or a custom Python environment.
Configurable parameters: deck count, dealer rules, payouts, side bets.
Enable card counting by tracking dealt cards and computing running/true counts.
State and Action Spaces
State Space:
Base Variant: Player’s hand value, dealer’s upcard, usable ace.
Multi-Deck Variants: Include running count or true count.
Deep RL: Experiment with raw card sequences or learned embeddings.
Action Space:
Core actions: hit, stand, double down, split.
Extended actions: bet sizing (continuous or discrete).
