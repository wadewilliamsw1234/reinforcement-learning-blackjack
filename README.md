# Reinforcement Learning Generalization Across Blackjack Variants

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

* **Problem Statement:** Blackjack is a widely recognized card game that offers a compelling testbed for reinforcement learning due to its stochastic nature and diverse rule sets. This project explores how reinforcement learning methods adapt and generalize their learning dynamics across blackjack variants with varying state-action complexities.

* **Motivation:** Generalization remains a pivotal challenge in RL, particularly for applications in dynamic or unseen environments. Studying blackjack variants provides insights into how RL agents handle rule changes, a problem with significant real-world relevance in fields like robotics, finance, and gaming.

* **Objectives:**

1. Investigate the learning dynamics of Q-learning, Deep Q-learning (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and additional RL algorithms across blackjack variants.

2. Integrate human strategies, such as basic strategy and card counting, alongside betting systems for comparative analysis.

3. Assess how RL agents generalize policies across variants with differing numbers of decks, rules, and complexities.

4. Develop an advanced, portfolio-worthy study showcasing expertise in RL and problem-solving.

### State Space

* **Player’s Current Hand Value:** This is the total value of the player’s hand, typically ranging from 4 to 21 (since hands below 4 are rare after the initial deal, and hands above 21 are busts). This captures the player’s progress toward the goal of 21.

* Range: 4 to 21 (18 possible values).

* **Usable Ace:** A binary indicator (0 or 1) showing whether the player’s hand includes an ace that can be counted as 11 without busting. This is crucial because a usable ace affects decision-making (e.g., a hand of Ace-6 can be 7 or 17).

* **Values:** 0 (no usable ace) or 1 (usable ace).

* **Dealer’s Upcard:** The value of the dealer’s visible card, which ranges from 2 to Ace. In RL, this is often represented numerically from 2 to 11 (with face cards as 10 and Ace as 11), as it informs the player about the dealer’s potential hand.

* Range: 2 to 11 (10 possible values).

- This results in a total state space size of: 18 (player’s hand values) × 2 (usable ace) × 10 (dealer’s upcard) = 360 states.

### Action Space

* **Hit:** Take another card to increase the hand value.

* **Stand:** End the turn and let the dealer play.

* **Double Down:** Double the bet and take exactly one more card, then stand (legal only on certain hands, depending on the rules).

* **Split:** If the initial two cards form a pair, split them into two separate hands (legal only with pairs).

* **Surrender:** Forfeit the hand and lose half the bet (legal only if the variation allows it, typically after the initial deal).

The full action space is: {Hit, Stand, Double Down, Split, Surrender}

However: 

* **State-Dependent Legality:** Not all actions are legal in every state. For example, Split is only available with a pair, Double Down may be restricted to specific hand values (e.g., 9, 10, 11 in some variations), and Surrender may not exist in some rule sets.

* **Environment Handling:** The RL environment specifies the legal actions for each state based on the current variation and hand. The agent selects from these legal actions, ensuring compatibility across variations without changing the action space definition.

#### Blackjack Variations

To assess performance and generalization, consider the following variations, which introduce meaningful differences in strategy and action availability:

1. Base Variation: Dealer stands on soft 17, no surrender, double down allowed on any two cards, split allowed up to three times.

2. Variation A: Dealer hits on soft 17 (alters optimal hitting/standing decisions).

3. Variation B: Surrender allowed (adds a new action, affecting early decision-making).

4. Variation C: Double down restricted to hand values of 9, 10, or 11 (limits doubling opportunities).

These variations affect the environment’s dynamics (e.g., dealer behavior) and legal actions (e.g., availability of surrender), allowing us to test how RL methods adapt and generalize.

### Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

To study performance and generalization, select a mix of classic, tabular RL algorithms suitable for Blackjack’s discrete and relatively small state-action space. The following algorithms are recommended:

#### Monte Carlo Control with Exploring Starts:

* **Description:** Estimates the value of state-action pairs by averaging returns over full episodes, using exploring starts to ensure all actions are tried.

* **Why:** Blackjack episodes are short and terminate naturally (win, lose, or draw), making Monte Carlo methods effective. Exploring starts ensures adequate exploration in this episodic task.

* **Use:** Learns an optimal policy by sampling complete games.

#### Q-Learning:

* **Description:** A model-free, off-policy method that updates a Q-table (state-action values) using the Bellman optimality equation with epsilon-greedy exploration.

* **Why:** Its off-policy nature allows it to learn the optimal policy regardless of the exploration strategy, making it robust for comparing performance across variations.

* **Use:** Tabular Q-table (360 states × 5 actions) updated iteratively.

#### SARSA:

* **Description:** An on-policy method that updates the Q-table based on the action taken under the current policy, also using epsilon-greedy exploration.

* **Why:** Contrasts with Q-Learning by reflecting the policy actually followed, potentially leading to safer strategies in varying environments.

* **Use:** Similar tabular setup as Q-Learning, allowing direct comparison.

Why Tabular Methods?

* The state space (360 states) and action space (up to 5 actions) are small enough for tabular methods, avoiding the complexity of function approximation (e.g., neural networks like DQN or Actor-Critic).

* Tabular methods provide interpretable results and are sufficient to learn optimal policies in this discrete setting.

**Exploration:** Use epsilon-greedy exploration (e.g., ε = 0.1, decaying over time) for Q-Learning and SARSA to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Study Design

To evaluate performance and generalization:

* **Single Variation Training:** Train each algorithm on the Base Variation and evaluate on Base, A, B, and C to assess generalization to unseen rules.

* **Multi-Variation Training:** Train on a mix of variations (e.g., Base and A, randomly selected per episode) and test on all variations, including unseen ones (e.g., B and C), to see if exposure to multiple rules improves robustness.

* **Metrics:** Measure learning speed (episodes to convergence), final performance (average reward), and policy quality (e.g., comparison to known optimal strategies where available).

**Additional Notes**

* **Reward Structure:** Use a simplified reward of +1 (win), 0 (draw), -1 (loss) for consistency across variations, ignoring betting nuances like 3:2 blackjack payouts.

* **Discount Factor:** Set γ = 1 since Blackjack is an episodic task with no infinite horizon.
